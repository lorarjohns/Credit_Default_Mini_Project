# Predicting Credit Default

This was a partner project completed over the course of a week in which teams of students competed to produce the model that would best predict the creditors who were likely to default on payment.

The data were imbalanced, having far greater numbers of payers than defaulters, and had significant other challenging features.

In the end, Eric Ma and I produced the second-highest scoring model of the class (beating out the instructor's!).
